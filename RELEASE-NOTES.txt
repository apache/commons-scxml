                         Commons SCXML Package
                          Version 0.8-SNAPSHOT
                            Release Notes

INTRODUCTION:

Commons SCXML 0.7 primarily contains new features, along with a
handful of bug fixes. See about section at the end for general information
on Commons SCXML.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

 o State IDs can no longer contain whitespace. Any IDs that contain spaces
   must be changed to conform before switching to v0.7.

 o Behavior related to wild card event name handling for transitions has
   changed (now aligns with latest Working Draft).

 o org.apache.commons.scxml.io.SCXMLDigester has been deprecated in favor
   of SCXMLParser in same package. See Javadocs for changes before switching.

NEW FEATURES:

 o Conflicts between transitions are now resolved based on document order
   of the transitions.

 o Transition targets can now be specified as a space separated list of
   state IDs. When more than one targets are specified, they must belong
   to regions of the same parallel.

 o <final> is supported (by org.apache.commons.scxml.io.SCXMLParser).

 o <event> is supported (by org.apache.commons.scxml.io.SCXMLParser).

DEPRECATIONS:

See Javadocs of each item for details. All deprecated items are scheduled for
removal in v1.0.

 o org.apache.commons.scxml.env.AbstractStateMachine#getStateMachine()

   org.apache.commons.scxml.model.Transition#getTarget()
   org.apache.commons.scxml.model.Transition#setTarget(TransitionTarget)

 o org.apache.commons.scxml.semantics.ErrorConstants#NON_DETERMINISTIC

BUG FIXES:

 o [SCXML-45] - Payload of events sent to current scxml session using <send>
                tag not injected into engine
 o [SCXML-48] - Cannot create more than one subclass of AbstractStateMachine
 o [SCXML-49] - SimpleSCXMLInvoker may miss transition to final state
 o [SCXML-51] - <assign> with location and expr both containing datamodel
                expressions concatenates old and new values
 o [SCXML-52] - Error on resolving conflicting transitions for compound states
 o [SCXML-53] - Wild card event name handling on transitions is not in line
                with W3C WD
 o [SCXML-54] - Events from custom actions missing payload
 o [SCXML-56] - onentry and onexit child elements of parallel do not have
                parent
 o [SCXML-58] - SCXML not stateless because of State class
 o [SCXML-60] - Possible race condition in AsyncTrigger
 o [SCXML-61] - Clarify interaction patterns for Invoker implementations with
                parent state machine executor

IMPROVEMENTS:

 o [SCXML-41] - Adding information about original expression to evaluation
                error messages
 o [SCXML-46] - Provide a SCXMLListener abstract adapter class
 o [SCXML-55] - Add support for <event> tag

OTHER CHANGES:

 o SCXMLExecutor logs state at a lower severity (changed from log level
   'info' to log level 'debug')

 o The LCA of two states belonging to sibling regions is now the enclosing
   Parallel, rather than the orthogonal State.

 o The regions of a parallel are entered in document order. This is
   implementation-specific behavior and users should not rely on it.

 o AbstractStateMachine and SimpleSCXMLListener classes, as well as the two
   standalone testing classes in the test package, have switched to the new
   SCXMLParser class.

 o Recommended version of Commons Logging has been upgraded to v1.1.1.

ABOUT COMMONS SCXML:

The Commons SCXML (State Chart XML) project provides a generic
state-machine based execution environment. It borrows most semantics
from its namesake Working Draft at the W3C. Anything that can be
represented as a UML state chart -- business process flows, view
navigation bits, interaction or dialog management, and many more -- can
leverage the Commons SCXML library. The library abstracts out the
environment interfaces, and can be used in numerous server-side and
client-side runtimes.
