  <section name="Commons SCXML - Pluggable expression languages">

   <p>The SCXML specification allows implementations to support
      multiple expression languages to enable using SCXML documents
      in varying environments. These expressions become part of
      attribute values for executable content, such as:

    <pre>
     &lt;var name="foo" expr="1 + 2 + bar" /&gt;
    </pre>

      or are used to evaluate the boolean guard conditions that
      decide whether or not a particular transition is followed
      once its associated trigger event is received, such as: 

    <pre>
     &lt;transition event="day.close" cond="day eq 'Friday'"
                 target="weekend" /&gt;
    </pre>

      To that end, the <code>Context</code>
      and <code>Evaluator</code> interfaces serve as adapters to the
      particular expression language APIs for a given usecase.</p>

   <p>Variable resolution bubbles up from the current state up to the
      document root, similar to variable shadowing via blocks in a
      procedural language.</p>

   <subsection name="What is a Context?">
    <p>The <code>Context</code> is a collection of variables that defines
       a variable "scope". Each &lt;state&gt; element within an SCXML
       document gets its own Context or variable scope.</p>
   </subsection>

   <subsection name="What is a root context?">
    <p>The root context is the context that may be supplied to the
       Commons SCXML engine as representing the variables in the
       "host environment". See
       <code>SCXMLExecutor#setRootContext(Context)</code> from the
       <a href="../apidocs/index.html">Javadoc</a>.</p>
   </subsection>

   <subsection name="What is an Evaluator?">
    <p>The <code>Evaluator</code> is a component with the capability
       of parsing and evaluating expressions. It is the "expression
       language engine".</p>
   </subsection>

  </section>

  <section name="Available expression languages">

   <p>Commons SCXML currently supports using Commons JEXL and
      Commons EL (JSP 2.0 EL) as the expression language.
      The expressions throughout the document must be homogeneous.
      This also applies to any external documents that may be refered
      by this document, for example via "src" attributes, like so: 

    <pre>
     &lt;state id="foo" src="foo.xml"&gt;
      &lt;!-- Something, possibly very interesting, here --&gt;
     &lt;/state&gt;
    </pre>

      Here, foo.xml must use the same expression language as
      the document above that hosts the state foo.<br/>

      Check out the <a href="core-engine.html">engine API docs</a>
      on how to plug in the suitable root context and evaluator
      tuple.</p>

   <subsection name="Commons JEXL">
    <p>See
    <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/scxml2/env/jexl/package-summary.html">
    org.apache.commons.scxml2.env.jexl package summary</a> for the
    relevant root context and evaluator tuple to use.</p>
   </subsection>

   <subsection name="Commons EL (JSP 2.0 EL)">
    <p>See
    <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/scxml2/env/jsp/package-summary.html">
    org.apache.commons.scxml2.env.jsp package summary</a> for the
    relevant root context and evaluator tuple to use.</p>
   </subsection>

  </section>

  <section name="Method invocation in expressions">

   <p>Commons SCXML uses the mechanisms provided by the expression language
   chosen for the document to support method invocation. Commons JEXL and
   Commons EL allow for method invocations as follows:</p>

   <subsection name="Commons JEXL">
    <p>See Commons JEXL reference for 
    <a href="http://commons.apache.org/jexl/reference/syntax.html#Functions">
    builtin JEXL functions</a> and the calling methods section of the
    <a href="http://commons.apache.org/jexl/reference/examples.html">
    examples page</a>. As a summary, if the context contains an object
    under name <code>foo</code> which has an accessible method
    <code>bar()</code>, then the JEXL expression for calling the method is
    <code>foo.bar()</code></p>
   </subsection>

   <subsection name="Commons EL (JSP 2.0 EL)">
    <p>It is possible to register "namespaced" functions with the
    <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/scxml2/env/jsp/ELEvaluator.html">
    ELEvaluator</a> to enable method invocation. The methods need to be
    static accessible methods in the class(es) that implement(s) them,
    and a suitable <code>FunctionMapper</code> is passed in via the
    ELEvaluator constructor. For further details, see the JSP 2.0 EL API.</p>
