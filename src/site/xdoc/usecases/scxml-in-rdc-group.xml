  <title>Commons SCXML Usecases - Dialog Management Strategy for rdc:group</title>

  <section name="SCXML documents to configure RDC group container instances">
   
   <p><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/doc/rdc-doc/intro.html">
   Reusable Dialog Components (RDC) Framework</a> is &quot;<i>a framework
   for creating JSP taglibs that aid in rapid development of voice and 
   multimodal applications</i>&quot;. The RDC Framework defines a
   <code>&lt;group&gt;</code> container for aggregating multiple components
   in one view. The dialog management across the child components for a
   group is pluggable, more details are available on this RDC wiki page on 
   <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-taglibs/ReusableDialogComponents/Tutorials/Aggregation">
   aggregation</a>. A Commons SCXML driven dialog management strategy has
   been incorporated into the RDC Framework, as seen
   <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/taglibs/proper/rdc/trunk/src/org/apache/taglibs/rdc/dm/">
   here</a>.
   </p>

   <subsection name="Motivation">
    <ul>
     <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml">SCXML</a> semantics are based 
     on UML state charts, and provide an easy transition from the modeling
     layer to the runtime artifacts.</li>
     <li>The SCXML based strategy is more expressive than the precursor 
     strategies that were previously available in the RDC distribution.</li>
    </ul>

  <section name="Example">
   <p>To illustrate the use of the SCXML strategy for &lt;rdc:group&gt;,
   consider a simple air travel information speech dialog, which prompts
   the user for the trip type (one way or round trip), and collect either
   one travel date or two depending on the answer.</p>

   <subsection name="UML Diagram">
    <p>Here is the
    <a href="rdc-group/travel-info.jpg">UML state machine diagram</a>
    that represents this SCXML-based travel information speech dialog.</p>
   </subsection>

   <subsection name="Code">
    <p>That gives us the following JSP snippet, if named variable
    <code>today</code> contains the <i>MMddyyyy</i> string for the
    current date:</p>
    <pre>
  &lt;rdc:group             id=&quot;travelInfo&quot; 
                    strategy=&quot;org.apache.taglibs.rdc.dm.SCXMLDialog&quot;
                      config=&quot;<a href="rdc-group/travel-dialog.xml">travel-dialog.xml</a>&quot;&gt;

      &lt;rdc:select1     id=&quot;tripType&quot;
                     options=&quot;<a href="rdc-group/travel-types.xml">travel-types.xml</a>&quot; 
                        echo=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;

      &lt;rdc:usMajorCity id=&quot;departureCity&quot; /&gt;

      &lt;rdc:usMajorCity id=&quot;arrivalCity&quot; /&gt;

      &lt;rdc:date        id=&quot;departureDate&quot;
                     minDate=&quot;${today}&quot;
                     confirm=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;

      &lt;rdc:date        id=&quot;arrivalDate&quot;
                     minDate=&quot;${departureDate}&quot;
                     confirm=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;/rdc:group&gt;
