  <section name="SCXML documents to describe Shale dialogs">

   <p><a href="http://shale.apache.org/">Shale</a> is
   &quot;<i>a modern web application framework, fundamentaly
   based on JavaServer Faces</i>&quot;. The Shale Framework includes a Dialog
   Manager, to describe &quot;conversations&quot; or &quot;dialogs&quot;
   (involving multiple views) with the user. Such a dialog is described
   using a state-machine like declarative notation defined by the Shale
   Framework. An alternative is using SCXML to describe the Shale dialogs
   by introducing a <code>DialogNavigationHandler</code> that uses the
   Commons SCXML engine.
   </p>

   <subsection name="Motivation">
    <ul>
     <li>SCXML semantics support parallelism, allowing multiple dialogs
     to execute at the same time (a.k.a regions), and interact with each
     other. This will be useful as Shale Dialog Managers evolve.</li>
     <li>The Commons SCXML implementation allows for registering listeners
     that get notified as the state machine executes (onentry, onexit,
     ontransition).</li>
     <li>Those developing multi-channel applications, or using frameworks
     that use SCXML for the controller bits in other contexts (e.g. 
     RDC framework), may be inclined towards SCXML-based authoring for Shale
     dialogs.</li>
    </ul>
