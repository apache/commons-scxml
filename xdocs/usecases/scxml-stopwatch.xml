  <section name="Using SCXML documents to define behavior">
   
   <p>SCXML documents (more generically, UML state chart diagrams) can be used
      to define stateful behavior of objects, and Commons SCXML enables
      developers to take this model directly into the corresponding code
      artifacts. The resulting artifacts tend to be much simpler, embody a
      useful separation of concerns and are easier to understand and maintain.
   </p>

   <subsection name="Motivation">
    <ul>
     <li>Demonstrate a "standalone" usecase of Commons SCXML
         (some of the other usecases are "frameworky" in nature and require
         additional knowledge of the framework the particular usecase
         refers to).</li>
     <li>Demonstrate the useful separation of concerns, the
         simplicity of the resulting artifacts, and the direct association
         between the model and the code when using Commons SCXML to
         incorporate behavior.</li>
    </ul>
   </subsection>

  </section>

  <section name="Sample walkthrough - From model to working code">

   <p>Here is a short exercise in modeling and implementing an object with
      stateful behavior. A stopwatch -- for anyone who may need an introduction
      -- is used to measure duration, with one button for starting and stopping
      the watch and another one for pausing the display (also known as "split",
      where the watch continues to keep time while the display is frozen, to
      measure, for example, "lap times" in races). Once the watch has been
      stopped, the start/stop button may be used to reset the display.
   </p>

   <subsection name="The Model - UML Diagram">
    <p>Here is the state chart diagram that describes the behavior
       of this particular stopwatch:<br/>

          src="scxml-stopwatch/stopwatch.jpg" border="0"
          alt="stopwatch state chart diagram"/></a><br/>
       (<a href="scxml-stopwatch/stopwatch-model.jpg">Zoom out</a>)
    </p>
   </subsection>

   <subsection name="The SCXML document">
    <p>The SCXML document is then, a simple serialization of
       the "model" above:
       <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/commons/proper/scxml/trunk/src/test/java/org/apache/commons/scxml/env/stopwatch.xml">stopwatch.xml</a>.
    </p>
   </subsection>

   <subsection name="The Stopwatch class">
    <p>Here is the class that implements the stopwatch behavior,
       <a href="../xref-test/org/apache/commons/scxml/env/StopWatch.html">StopWatch.java</a>.
       The class extends
       <a href="../xref/org/apache/commons/scxml/env/AbstractStateMachine.html">AbstractStateMachine.java</a>,
       which provides one approach for providing the base functionality
       needed by classes representing stateful entities. Points to note
       in the StopWatch class are:
       <ul>
        <li>The "lifecycle" is defined by the SCXML document, which is
            an artifact easily derived from the modeling layer.</li>
        <li>The code is much simpler, since the lifecycle management
            task has been assigned to Commons SCXML.</li>
       </ul>
    </p>
   </subsection>

   <subsection name="The Stopwatch UI">
    <p>Here is the UI for our demonstration,
       <a href="../xref-test/org/apache/commons/scxml/env/StopWatchDisplay.html">StopWatchDisplay.java</a>.
       Points to note here are:
       <ul>
        <li>The UI is "backed" by a StopWatch instance.</li>
        <li>It merely relays the user initiated events (in this case,
            button clicks) to the Commons SCXML driven StopWatch
            instance by serving as an intermediary / proxy.</li>
        <li>The UI and application behavior separation is thus, and
            usefully, pronounced.</li>
       </ul>
    </p>
